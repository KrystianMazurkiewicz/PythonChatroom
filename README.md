To add bots to your chatroom you need to type in either "invite shyvana", "invite samanta", "invite holmes" or "invite cristiano". All of these are commands to invite a bot to your chat room. You can choose which bots are welcome in your chatroom, and if you open another client.py you can then start chatting with yourself. To disconnect type "dc" and close the window.
